# Seating Chart

This branch of the seating chart is dedicated to a next.js + express recreation of the current implementation.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://git.lcdi/Programmers/seating-chart -b node`
2. `cd seating-chart`
3. `npm install` or if you prefer to use yarn, `yarn install`

## Running

Running the application is extremely simple. Make sure you are in the `seating-chart` directory then run:

`npm run dev` or, if you use yarn: `yarn run dev`

## Goal

The goal or purpose of this rewrite is because the authors of this branch believe the current implementation of the seating-chart is 
not well maintainable, and the code is messy. This new implementation will allow for greater maintainability and easy bug fixing. React
comes with much greater dev tools (Chrome Extension `React Developer Tools` found 
[Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)).
This implementation will be much more familiar for many to work on as well, since Computer Science Majors are generally taught some JavaScript
through the Champlain Curriculum in their first semester. There great docs for many of the libraries which are easily searchable through Google.
Overall, it may be a lot of work to re-create the seating chart. However, if it is successful, it will greatly decrease the amount of time
needed for a new member of the team to get started on bug fixing and general feature development.
